However, based on the table description that suggests the values in column 0 are \"names of objects, which could be football teams, actors, or any other entities\", the first entity seems to be a more likely match."}, "(1, 0)": {"id": "Q9328250", "llm_output": "[[[Q9328250]]]"}, "(2, 0)": {"id": "Q9327620", "llm_output": "[[[Q9327620]]]"}}}
